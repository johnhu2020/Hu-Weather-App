# Weather Forecast App

**Created using React Native expo**

  This is my weather forecast app that gives the user the corresponding location and its weather forecast based on the user entered coordinates. The app gives a brief description of the current weather, the temperature, high & low, wind speed, wind description, and the feels like temperature. At the bottom of the screen, the app also displays the forecast for the next 5 days, providing each days' average tempearture as well as an icon that illustrates the weather for that day. 

  *Issues:
  I may have some trouble for the aesthetics regarding to the line spacings of the next 5 day forecast's temperatures and weather conditions icons. For negative numbers, since the number includes a negative symbol that takes up some space, I added less spaces in between that number and the next number. For numbers that only have 1 decimal, I added 4 spaces and 2 decimals adds 5 spaces. For numbers that do not have decimals at all, I added 6 spaces. Sometimes when I run my app, the spaces are messed up, and the next line, which includes my weather conditions icons, may join the same line as the next 5 day forecast's temperatures, messing up the aesthetics. Also, the app on ios and andriod are different, so a specific set of coordinates may look perfectly fine on ios but not on andriod and vise versa.
